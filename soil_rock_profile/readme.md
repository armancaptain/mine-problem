Drawing the geological profile based on Machine Learning Algorithm
----

Data - 10 Borehole data | each borhole is of 30m depth and consisting of data -
1. UCS (unaxial compressive strength)
2. RQD (rock quality designation)
3. Depth of the sample 
4. Chainage of the borehole

Objective - Mapping the rock profile from given borehole data.

[Rock Quality Designation (RQD)](https://theconstructor.org/geotechnical/rqd-rock-quality-designation-calculation/20536/) - Rock Quality Designation (RQD) is a measure of quality of rock core taken from a borehole. RQD signifies the degree of jointing or fracture in a **rock mass** measured in percentage, where RQD of 75% or more shows good quality hard rock and less than 50% show low quality weathered rocks

**Note: RQD is a rock mass property.**

[Uniaxial Compressive Strength (UCS)](https://civilblog.org/2013/08/11/unconfined-compressive-strength-of-rock-sample-is-9143-1979/) - The objective of this test is to determine unconfined compressive strength of rock. This test is primarily done to classify the **intact rock** on the basis of strength. 

**Note: The UCS of rock is an intact rock property**
